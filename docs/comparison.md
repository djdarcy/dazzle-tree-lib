        self.parent = parent
        # Manual traversal setup...

# DazzleTreeLib approach
from dazzletreelib.aio import traverse_tree_async

async for node in traverse_tree_async("/path"):
    print(node.path)
```

- No tree-specific features

**Best for**: Performance-critical graph analysis

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose DazzleTreeLib when you need:
- ✅ To traverse multiple types of trees with the same code
- ✅ Async tree operations for I/O-bound tasks
- ✅ To compose behaviors (filtering + caching + custom logic)
- ✅ Clean separation between traversal logic and data access
- ✅ To switch between data sources without changing code
- ✅ Production-ready error handling and streaming

### Choose alternatives when you need:
- **anytree**: Simple in-memory trees with ASCII visualization
- **treelib**: Maximum performance for in-memory operations
- **NetworkX**: Graph algorithms beyond tree traversal
- **bigtree**: Integration with pandas/data science workflows
- **igraph**: Extreme performance for large graphs

## Performance Considerations

| Library | Relative Speed | Memory Usage | Async Support |
|---------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **os.scandir** | Baseline (1x) | Minimal | ❌ |
| **igraph** | 0.9x | Low | ❌ |
| **treelib** | 0.8x | Moderate | ❌ |

| **NetworkX** | 0.1x | High | ❌ |
| **anytree** | 0.1x | High | ❌ |

*Note: Performance varies by use case. DazzleTreeLib prioritizes flexibility over raw speed.*

## Code Comparison

### Task: Traverse filesystem and filter Python files

**DazzleTreeLib**:
```python
from dazzletreelib.aio import traverse_tree_async

async for node in traverse_tree_async("/project"):
    if node.path.suffix == '.py':
        print(node.path)
```

**anytree**:
```python
from anytree import Node, RenderTree
import os

def build_tree(path, parent=None):
    node = Node(path, parent=parent)
    if os.path.isdir(path):
        for child in os.listdir(path):
            build_tree(os.path.join(path, child), node)
    return node

root = build_tree("/project")
for pre, fill, node in RenderTree(root):
    if node.name.endswith('.py'):
        print(node.name)
```

**treelib**:
```python
from treelib import Tree
import os

tree = Tree()
def add_to_tree(path, parent=None):
    node_id = tree.create_node(path, path, parent=parent)
    if os.path.isdir(path):
        for child in os.listdir(path):
            add_to_tree(os.path.join(path, child), path)

add_to_tree("/project")
# Manual filtering required after building tree
```

## Migration Guide

### From anytree to DazzleTreeLib

1. Replace NodeMixin classes with Node + Adapter
2. Convert manual tree building to adapter pattern
3. Use traverse_tree instead of RenderTree

### From treelib to DazzleTreeLib

1. Replace Tree() with appropriate adapter
2. Convert tree.create_node() to Node creation
3. Use traversal functions instead of tree methods

### From os.walk to DazzleTreeLib

1. Replace os.walk with traverse_tree_async
2. Add filtering via FilteringAdapter if needed
3. Benefit from async I/O parallelism

## Ecosystem Integration

DazzleTreeLib works well alongside other libraries:

- **Use with pandas**: Create custom adapter for DataFrame hierarchies
- **Use with SQLAlchemy**: Database tree adapter for ORM models
- **Use with FastAPI**: Async traversal in web endpoints
- **Use with pytest**: Mock adapters for testing

## Future Compatibility

DazzleTreeLib is designed to grow with the Python ecosystem:

- Planned adapters for cloud storage (S3, Azure, GCS)
- GraphQL hierarchy traversal
- Integration with popular ORMs
- Community-contributed adapters

## Summary

DazzleTreeLib fills a unique niche in the Python ecosystem as the only library providing universal tree traversal through adapters. While other libraries excel in specific areas (anytree for simplicity, igraph for performance, NetworkX for algorithms), DazzleTreeLib is a good choice when you need to work with multiple tree-like data sources using consistent code.

The trade-off of some performance for high flexibility makes DazzleTreeLib ideal for modern applications that integrate multiple data sources, require async operations, or need clean, maintainable code for tree traversal.
