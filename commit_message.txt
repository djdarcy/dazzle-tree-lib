Fix Issue #43: Simplify semantic distinction for filter/tracking

Performance-optimized solution for filter/tracking layer confusion.
Since SmartCachingAdapter doesn't filter internally, was_exposed()
simply returns was_discovered(), eliminating unnecessary tracking overhead.

Changes:
- Add was_exposed() method that returns was_discovered()
- Add was_filtered() method that always returns False
- Remove exposure tracking infrastructure (sets, dicts, methods)
- Update TraversalTracker to treat exposure as discovery
- Remove track_exposure() calls from get_children()

Tests: All 378 tests passing (7 filter tests now enabled)
Performance: Fast mode now correctly faster than safe mode

Resolves #43 - semantic distinction without performance penalty
